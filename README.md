# Wheel Assembly in CATIA

## Overview

This repository showcases a **Wheels Assembly** designed entirely in CATIA. The project highlights my skills in 3D modeling, parametric part design, and assembly, with each component created from scratch and unified into a fully constrained assembly. This project serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my ability and proficiency in mechanical CAD design.

## Design Components and Features Used

| Part         | Features Used                | Description                                                            |
|--------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Base**     | Pad                         | Provides foundational support for the assembly.                        |
| **Bolt**     | Pad, Groove                 | Key fastener joining components together.                              |
| **Bush Cap** | Pad                         | Ensures alignment and smooth rotation of the wheel.                    |
| **Screw**    | Shaft                       | Additional fastener for enhanced fit and mechanical strength.          |
| **Nut**      | Pad, Pocket, Groove         | Secures the bolt and provides structural stability.                    |
| **Support**  | Edge Fillet, Pocket, Pad    | Maintains vertical alignment and supports the wheel structure.         |
| **Wheel**    | Shaft                       | Main rotating

## Assembly Process

- **Individual Part Creation:**  
  Each part was designed independently in CATIA, using fundamental modeling tools.
- **Assembly in CATIA:**  
  All parts were imported into the Assembly Design workbench and fully constrained to ensure accurate placement and function.
- **Documentation:**  
  Screenshots of each stage and detailed images are provided for visual verification of the process.
